The python scripts plot_hist_and_porosity.py and plot_band_angle_dofs.py
can be used to plot the porosity field of the last timestep of a shear
bands model together with the histograms showing the distribtion of 
band angles. In addition, plot_hist_and_porosity.py will generate files
that can be used as input for plotting the dominant band angle with
plot_band_angle_dofs.py, which plots the mode of a lognormal distribution
fitted to the distribution of band angles. Both scripts will use the data
files present in the folder as input if run without arguments, where the 
input files for plot_hist_and_porosity.py have to be extracted from the
.zip files first.
